What’s Real was my first ever Game Jam game. This was part of the 2022 Brackeys Game Jam and the theme was “It is not Real”. The Idea I had was to make a fun platformer, with a slight twist being some of the platforms were holograms(fake). Players had to identify and avoid stepping on the fake platforms to be able to progress to the next level. The game jam lasted for a week and I decided to do this solo.

Towards the end of the jam, I ran into several challenges due to overscoping the project. A lot of the features I wanted to add proved unfeasible given the limited time I had. This forced me to remove and rework a lot of my gameplay to make sure everything still made sense. As a result, I was making last-minute adjustments right up until the deadline.

In the final moments of the game jam, the pressure got to me, causing me to make a mistake. I accidentally submitted the game to the wrong submission link just seconds before the deadline. By the time I realised the mistake, it was too late to rectify.

Although the Game Jam didn’t go as I wanted it to. It taught me a valuable lesson about choosing the correct scope for your project and having effective time management.
