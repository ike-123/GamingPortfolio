This was the first game I made with Unreal engine. I decided to learn Unreal as it seemed that for the games that I enjoyed makin(3d,Multiplayer), Unreal has a lot more tools to help facilitate my development. I was able to make this server authoritative Multiplayer game in Unreal Engine 5 in only 3 months, whereas it would have taken me a lot longer in Unity.
