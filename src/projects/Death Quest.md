Disappointed in the result of my last Jam. I joined another Game Jam, with the intention of learning from all of the mistakes I made during the first one. This Game Jam was hosted by GameDev.TV and the theme was “Death is only the beginning”. After spending a couple hours thinking of a game mechanic I decided it was going to be an escape room platformer, which featured "death" as an integral part of the gameplay. Having done some planning, I knew this would be feasible to create within the duration of the jam which was 10 days.

Overall the Game Jam was quite successful. Out of the 922 entries my game was ranked 26th. I was thrilled with the result and was glad to see my determination pay off.
