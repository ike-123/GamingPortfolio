Having been inspired by some of my favourite games battle Royale games like Fortnite and PUBG, I set out to make an even more ambitious game in Unity. Using the Photon Pun networking Library I was able to create BattleVerse, a 3rd person Multiplayer shooter game with 5 unique levels. The game incorporates responsive movement, a range of different weapons, animations and unique mechanics From the start I was committed to modelling all assets, environments and characters in the game. This was so I could improve on my modelling skills while gaining a deeper understanding of the Unity to Blender workflow.
