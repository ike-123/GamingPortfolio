This was a fun little project I worked on, The Idea is you are an action figure In a kids bedroom, surrounded by toys. Players have complete freedom to interact with their environment, whether it’s blasting toys across the room or stacking them to build something unique and imaginative.

One achievement I’m most proud of in this game was creating the block picker tool. This uses a Raycast to detect when a block is selected, followed by a SphereCast to check if it's in close proximity to another block. If a nearby block is detected, the selected block snaps into place next to it. This makes it really easy and intuitive for players to start building.
