This Project isn’t technically a game, however serves as a showcase of another successful project I made in Unity. Using Unity I was able to create accurate racing simulations of athletes like Usain Bolt and Mbappe. I was able to upload these videos on YouTube and have amassed over 7 million views on the channel SpeedShowdown.
