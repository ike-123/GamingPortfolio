            I started development of this game 1 month into learning game development and it marks the first ambitious project that I worked 
            on. This game initially started as a platformer and worked later transformed into a hybrid platformer and shooter. This project
             was extremely beneficial, as it boosted my proficiency in and also allowed me to learn new programming patterns and techniques
              Commonly used in Unity C#.

          Having been inspired by some of my favourite games battle Royale games like Fortnite and PUBG, I set out to make an even more ambitious game in Unity, A Multiplayer Shooter game.
          Using the Photon Pun networking Library I was able to create BattleVerse, a 3rd person Multiplayer shooter game with 5 unique levels. The game incorporates  responsive movement, a range of different weapons, animations and unique mechanics. 
          From the start I was committed to modelling all Assets, environments and characters in the game. This was so I could improve on my modelling skills while gaining a deeper understanding of the Unity-to-Blender workflow.

        This was a fun little project I worked on, The Idea is you are an action figure In a kids bedroom, surrounded by toys. 
        Players have complete freedom to interact with their environment, whether it’s blasting toys across the room or stacking
         them to build something unique and imaginative. 

          <br> <br>
          One achievement I’m most proud of in this game was creating the block picker tool. This uses a Raycast to detect when a block
           is selected, followed by a SphereCast to check if it's in close proximity to another block. If a nearby block is detected, 
           the selected block snaps into place next to it. This makes it really easy and intuitive for players to start building.

      <p class="text-1">
        What’s Real was my first ever Game Jam game. This was part of the 2022 Brackeys Game Jam and the theme was 
        “It is not Real”. The Idea I had was to make a fun platformer, with a slight twist being some of the platforms 
        were holograms(fake) . Players had to identify and avoid stepping on the fake platforms to be able to progress 
        to the next level. The game jam lasted for a week and I decided to do this solo.

          <br> <br>

          Towards the end of the jam, I ran into several challenges, primarily due to overscoping the project. A lot of the 
          features I wanted to add proved unfeasible given the limited amount of time that I had. This forced me to, remove 
          and rework a lot of my gameplay to make sure everything was still coherent. As a result, I was making last-minute
           adjustments right up until the deadline.

          <br> <br>
          In the final moments of the jam, the pressure led to a mistake, as I accidentally submitted the game to the wrong 
          submission link, just seconds before the deadline. By the time I realised the mistake, it was too late to fix it. 

          <br> <br>
          Although the Game Jam didn’t go as I wanted it to. It taught me a valuable lesson about choosing the correct 
          scope for your project and having effective time management.

      <p class="text-1">
        Disappointed in the result of my last Jam. I joined another Game Jam, with the intention of learning from all 
        of the mistakes I made during the first one. This Game Jam was hosted by GameDev.TV and the theme was “Death 
        is only the beginning”. After spending a couple hours thinking of a game mechanic I decided it was going to be 
        an escape room platformer which made dying an integral part of the gameplay. Having done some planning I knew this 
        would be feasible to create within the duration of the jam which was 10 days.


          <br> <br>
          Overall the Game Jam was quite successful. Out of the 922 entries my game was ranked 26th. I was thrilled with
           the result and was glad to see my determination pay off.

        Unreal has a lot more tools to help facilitate my development. I was able to make this server authoritative 
        Multiplayer game in Unreal Engine 5 in only 3 months, whereas it would have taken me a lot longer in Unity.
